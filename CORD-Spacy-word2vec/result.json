    "description": "CORD-19(COVID-19 Open Research Dataset) is a resource of over 200,000 scholarly articles, including over 90,000 with full text, about COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, and related coronaviruses. This freely available dataset is provided to the global research community to apply recent advances in natural language processing and other AI techniques to generate new insights in support of the ongoing fight against this infectious disease. This model is trained using word2vec which processes text by vectorizing words i.e. each distinct word in its corpus is represented by a list of numbers (or a vector). Itâ€™s an unsupervised question answering model using semantic search."

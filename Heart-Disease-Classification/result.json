    "Description": "The MIT-BIH dataset has been used research into cardiac dynamics at more than 500 sites worldwide. This model uses the Convolutional Neural Net Architecture on image data of shape [1,187,1] and then classifies the image into one of the five labels the dataset has been divided into."
